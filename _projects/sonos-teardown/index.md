title: Automated Robotic Waste Sorting System
description: Developed an automated recycling system designed to sort containers based on material composition using both a virtual simulation and a physical prototype. The system combined a line-following robot with integrated sensors to detect recyclable materials, accurately deposit them into designated bins, and handle multiple objects efficiently. A full simulation environment was built using Quanser software to test arm movements, hopper interactions, and sorting logic before hardware integration. The physical model featured a 3D-printed and laser-cut assembly connected to actuators for controlled container transfer. The project emphasized system reliability, sensor accuracy, and seamless hardware-software operation, culminating in a fully functional recycling mechanism capable of quickly and accurately sorting various types of waste.
